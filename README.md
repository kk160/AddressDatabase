**READ ME ADDRESS DATABASE**


The AddressDatabase is a Java-based database in which you can search contacts, filter contact entries, add new contacts and delete them.

It is structured as follows:

  Main options:  
                                
                0: Browse person entries                        
                1: Toggle filtering person entries              
                2: Create new person entry                      
                3: Delete person entry                            
                4: Exit                                         


You enter the associated number in the terminal to perform the associated task.

With function 0, all existing contacts are displayed to the user in a list.
The contacts always contain the first and last name of the contact, the e-mail address and the telephone number can optionally be included.

With function 1, the user has the choice of sorting a contact by the first letter. e.g. from A to D.
In this way, an automated and rapid search of the entire database is possible, especially if there are many contacts.

With function 2 you can create a new contact and enter the storable data as already described in point 0.
A new contact entry is then written in the AddressDatabase.txt and the new data is added to the AddressDatabase.

With function 3, an existing and marked contact is deleted from the AdressDatabase.txt and thus disappears permanently from the contacts.

The 4 function closes the program. If desired, you can restart, the user ends up back in the main menu.
